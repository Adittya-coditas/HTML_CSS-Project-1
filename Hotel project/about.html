          <p>Old beach charm! Gorgeous room with fabulous view but the best was the staff. I particularly thank Emily at the desk. What a gracious and knowledgeable hostess. Our room was beyond expectations, the housekeeping staff was efficient, attentive. I have been to larger or newer (this one is on historic registry) but do not recall a better or accommodating staff. Emily, our sincere thanks for helping your "mountain living" guest a real beach experience . We look fwd to returning.!</p>
